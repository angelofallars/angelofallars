#### About Me

I'm just some guy who programs on Linux like a nerd (using Neovim btw). I write open-source software.

I've taken a fascination with [HTMX](https://htmx.org). I'm currently writing a [library in Go](https://github.com/angelofallars/htmx-go) to make working with HTMX in Go even more enjoyable.

I like modern systems programming languages: [Go](https://go.dev/), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and (learning) [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). I'm fascinated by how they balance performance with developer experience, and their unique ways of handling errors as values.
