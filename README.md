#### 👋 About me

Hi! I'm Angelo, a 22-year-old software engineer and open-source maintainer. I code on Linux (using Neovim btw).

I'm enthusiastic about both Go and Rust. You can be a fan of both languages!

I'm the creator of the [htmx-go](https://github.com/angelofallars/htmx-go) library with 700+ stars.
