#### 👋 About me

Hi! I'm Angelo, a 21-year-old software engineer and open-source developer. I code on Linux (using Neovim btw).

I'm passionate about Go, Rust, and HTMX. I'm the creator of the [htmx-go](https://github.com/angelofallars/htmx-go) library with 400+ stars.

I'm interested in compilers and programming language design. Recently, I've been working on an embeddable scripting language named [litok](https://git.sr.ht/~kolunmi/litok/tree/rust-version/item/README.md) implemented in Rust.
