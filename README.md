#### About Me

I'm just some guy who programs on Linux like a nerd (using Neovim btw). I write open-source software.

My current fascination is compilers and interpreters. Everything we do with computers - programs, apps, operating systems, games are built with these two - why wouldn't I be fascinated with them? 

I like modern systems programming languages: [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), [Go](https://go.dev/), and (learning) [Zig](https://ziglang.org/). I'm fascinated by how they balance performance with developer experience, and their unique ways of handling errors as values.
